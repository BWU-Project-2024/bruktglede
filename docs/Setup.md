# Set up Bruktglede

NB! This project uses `yarn` and NOT `npm`. So all new dependencies you add NEED to be added through yarn (instead of npm install, it's often yarn add).

## Step-by-step

1. Copy the GitHub repo link and add it to you computer, and open it in VSCode.
2. Add all dependencies with `yarn install`.
3. Create a .env file (in the outmost place in the project folder), and add the variables provided.
4. Install prisma devlopment `yarn add prisma --dev`
5. You can see the prisma schema in Prisma Studio: `prisma studio`.
6. Run next app on local host with `yarn dev`.
